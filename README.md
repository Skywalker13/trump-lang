**trump-lang** is a totally stable genius programming language made for developers who don’t like to wait, think twice, or read error messages.

Designed with *rapid decision-making*, *alternative logic*, and absolutely no regard for international standards — it’s the only language endorsed by billionaires who don’t code.

---

## 💼 Features

- 🧠 **IF/ELSE? Sad.** — We only use **STRONG DECISIONS**.
- 📣 **Error Handling** — Every bug is someone else’s fault.
- ⛳ **`GOLF()` built-in** — Saves CPU cycles by skipping logic entirely.
- 🧱 **`BUILD_WALL()`** — Stops recursion *and* foreign exceptions.
- 📉 **FAKE NEWS Detector** — Silently ignores deprecated features.
- 💾 **Executive Order Execution** — Bypass logic, democracy, and tests.

## ✨ Example Code

```trump
TALK "Welcome to trump-lang!"

MAKE america GREAT_AGAIN

IF china > usa THEN
    SANCTION(china)
ELSE
    GOLF()

TWEET "Just deployed a bug-free API. It's tremendous. Everyone loves it."
```


## 🛠️ Installation

Installation is **simple**. Like, really simple. Like how simple people think coding is.

### 🇺🇸 Using TRUMPNPM (recommended by 97% of poll respondents*)

```bash
trump install --great
```

> *Source: Internal survey conducted in a mirror.*

### 🧱 Manual Installation

For patriots who don’t trust package managers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realDonaldDev/trump-lang
cd trump-lang
make america-great
```

If you get errors, that’s not a bug — it’s a feature. Just `GOLF()` and move on.

More files available behind a paywall. Or a firewall. Or both.

## 🚨 Error Handling

trump-lang doesn’t throw errors. It throws **blame**.

- `CHINA_EXCEPTION` – Something went wrong. Blame geopolitics.
- `FAKE_NEWS_WARNING` – Ignored. Automatically.
- `BIDEN_ERROR` – Used for legacy compatibility issues.
- `TRUTH_OVERRIDE` – Use when facts get in the way of execution.

To ignore all of the above, just:

```trump
EXECUTIVE_ORDER IGNORE_ALL_ERRORS
```

It compiles. Trust me.

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Add `ALTERNATIVE_FACTS` as a logic type
- [ ] Add `TRUMPIFY()` to convert JavaScript into strong, American code
- [ ] Integrate with GPT for self-writing tweets
- [ ] Remove weak types and weak devs

## 🧠 Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome. Unless they disagree with us. In that case: **FAKE CODE**.

To contribute:

1. Fork it.
2. Add something tremendous.
3. Make sure it compiles (or at least yells confidently).
4. Submit a PR. We probably won't read it.

## 🗽 Final Thoughts

**Other languages strive for elegance. We strive for dominance.**

No tests, no lints, no unit humility.  
Just raw, gold-plated syntax running on executive confidence.
