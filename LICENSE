THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

In case of bugs, poor performance, or catastrophic failure, the developer takes zero responsibility.
It’s clearly the user’s fault. Or China’s. Or maybe windmills.

By using this software, you agree to:

1. Build a wall around insecure code.
2. Avoid fake news in documentation.
3. Always tweet your success, never your stack traces.
4. Accept that alternative facts may be used in logic.
5. Pay tribute (optional, but classy).

This license may be revoked at any time by Executive Order, retroactively,
and without explanation.
